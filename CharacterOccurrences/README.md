# Character Occurrences
A simple litte C++ program that uses a map to track the number of characters in a given string. 

I plan on improving this program to allow text files as input.

## Example
```
this is a sentence
        3
a       1
c       1
e       3
h       1
i       2
n       2
s       3
t       2
```

Whitespaces are counted as well!
