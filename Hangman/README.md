# Hangman
An older program I made that simulates a game of Hangman. 
It works but it feels somewhat hack-ish. I did not want to use an ACTUAL GUI library so I resorted to clearing the terminal after every update.

I would like to eventually port this to something simple like Ncurses.

Just compile and run the executable!
