# FileWrapper
A small wrapper used to make handling files in C++ just a little easier. Hopefully beginners can use this to quickly get into file I/O in C++ without 
too much of a headache.

Each class handles a single file. In the future, I will implement handling multiple files and folders. For now, declare an object for each file to 
access the methods.

This is not meant to be used by itself. Use this in conjunction with any program you're working on and make sure to include the appropriate files when compiling.


# Current public functions
1. Editing and appending to the file
2. Printing entire contents of file to the terminal
3. Character, word and line count
4. Size of files in bytes
5. Create a backup of the file
6. Searching for the first instance of a particular pattern

# Functions to be implemented in the future
1. Handling multiple files
2. Using folders
3. Copying and moving files
4. More advanced search features
