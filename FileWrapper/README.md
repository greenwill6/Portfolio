# FileWrapper
A small handler used to make handling files in C++ just a little easier. Hopefully beginners can use this to quickly get into file I/O in C++ without 
too much of a headache.

Each class handles a single file. In the future, I will implement handling multiple files and folders. For now, declare an object for each file to 
access the methods.

# Current public functions
1. Editing and appending to the file
2. Printing entire contents of file to the terminal
3. Character, word and line count
4. Size of files in bytes

# Functions to be implemented in the future
1. Handling multiple files
2. Using folders
3. Copying and moving files
4. Search features (grep)
