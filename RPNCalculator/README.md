# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
RPN for short, is a mathematical notation in which the operands come before the operator. 
So for instance : 
```
2 + 2
4
```
becomes
```
2 2 +
4
```

This is my version of a calculator using RPN in C++.
It uses some std algorithms and iterators. I use vectors to store the operands.

To use it, simply compile and run.
